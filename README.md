### How to use:

1. Download and decompile IMG files from these sources:

Compact direct links:
* 1m: https://prd-tnm.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=StagedProducts/Elevation/1m/IMG/
* 1/9 arc second (~3m): http://prd-tnm.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=StagedProducts/Elevation/19/IMG/
* 1/3 arc second (~10m): http://prd-tnm.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=StagedProducts/Elevation/13/IMG/
* 1 arc second (~30m): http://prd-tnm.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html?prefix=StagedProducts/Elevation/1/IMG/

Map directory for finding specific locations:
* 1m: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?collection_package_id=988723e5-b093-4520-9ea3-cbfea7769bae
* 1/9 arc second (~3m): https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?collection_package_id=14fa2d80-b6e6-4cda-a7f3-95d740b716e1
* I couldn't find 1/3
* 1 arc second (~30m): https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?collection_package_id=4c7396d3-21c7-4cc2-8c34-e42c4cc50ec3

Also there's Alaska data that's 5 meters but I haven't tested that

2. Make a new folder, drag the script in it, run the script

3. Drag and drop IMG files into the folder

4. Do this until you have every single location known on the planet ever compiled
